Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In my benchmarking study, I found that in the sparse, overlapping
binary setting, the GBCD estimate had negative entries. This shouldn’t
happen because the generalized binary prior is a non-negative prior.
Therefore, the estimate should have non-negative entries. The goal of
this analysis is to look into that. Right now, we hypothesize that it is
a bug in the code.</p>

<h1>Data Generation</h1>
<p>In this analysis, we simulate data as follows:</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be an <span
class="math inline">\(n \times p\)</span> matrix. <span
class="math inline">\(X = LF&#39; + E\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is an <span class="math inline">\(n
\times k\)</span> matrix, <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is an
<span class="math inline">\(p \times k\)</span> matrix, and <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is an <span class="math inline">\(n
\times p\)</span> matrix. The entries of <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> are independently drawn from a standard
normal distribution, <span class="math inline">\(E_{ij}
\overset{i.i.d.}{\sim} N(0,1)\)</span>. The entries of <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> are also drawn from a normal
distribution, <span class="math inline">\(F_{ij} \overset{i.i.d.}{\sim}
N(0, \sigma^2)\)</span>. The entries of <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> are drawn from a Bernoulli
distribution, <span class="math inline">\(L_{ij} \overset{i.i.d.}{\sim}
Bernoulli(\pi_1)\)</span>.</p>
<p>In this setting, each sample can be a member of multiple groups.
Therefore, we have overlapping structure. We usually set <span
class="math inline">\(\pi_1\)</span> to be small, e.g. <span
class="math inline">\(\pi_1 = 0.1\)</span> to ensure that each sample is

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I think the negative entries are due to a small nuance in the GBCD
model. Yusha uses a point-Laplace prior over one of the loadings columns
(the factor with the maximum column sum in the initialization matrix).
So the negative entries appear due to the point-Laplace prior. I’m not
sure I really understand the reasoning behind this choice in the model –
something to look into.</p>
<p>I also checked GBCD on the tree data. It seems like the factor with
the point-Laplace prior is all positive in this case. I also checked
GBCD on the non-overlapping group data. It seems like one of the group
effect factors actually has small negative values in it as well.</p>
