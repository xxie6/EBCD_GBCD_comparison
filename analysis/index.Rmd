This is my project comparing two covariance decomposition methods, Generalized Binary Covariance Decomposition (GBCD) and Empirical Bayes Covariance Decomposition (EBCD), from the Stephens Lab.  
  
Simulations:  
  
* Results for the [simple normal data simulation](simple-simulation-normal-data.html)
* Results for the [scRNA-seq dataset simulation without subtypes](simulation-analysis.html). 
* Results for the [scRNA-seq dataset simulation with subtypes](simulation-with-subtype.html)
  
Real Data Analysis:  
  
* Results for the [HNSCC data analysis](hnscc-analysis.html)

I also have some analyses targeted at bettering understanding the behavior of the EBCD algorithm.
